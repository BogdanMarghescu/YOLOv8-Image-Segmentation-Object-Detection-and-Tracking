YOLOv8 object detection, tracking and image segmentation using Ultralytics API (for detection and segmentation), as well as DeepSORT (for tracking) in Python.
The results of the detection are extracted and prepared for further processing.
For an enhanced user experience, the app interface is built using "streamlit" module from Python.
